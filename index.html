		<h1>TOR VANITY ADDRESSES FOR BITCOIN</h1><br />
		
		The TOR network is becoming increasingly popular, particularly after big companies
		such as facebook decided to use it for their regular business. However, hosting a
		website on TOR is a tedious business, as there is no traditional DNS system
		available to provide easy to remember hostname addresses. We like to change that
		by providing a service to manage pre-generated vanity addresses.
		
		<br /><br />
		Our vanity addresses are generated on a large scale with a sophisticated algorithm
		that is able to efficiently mine the huge search space of possible 16-char combinations.
		Furthermore our vanity addresses are much stronger than the one generated with free 
		software such as <a href="https://github.com/katmagic/Shallot">Shallot</a> or 
		<a href="https://github.com/lachesis/scallion">Scallion</a>. This is because those
		are generating RSA key pairs, that include public exponent which is only an odd 
		number, and not a prime. On the other hand, our hostnames are based on RSA keys, 
		generated by strong prime numbers that pass the Miller-Rabin primality test and the
		public exponent is guaranteed to be a primer number. Thus, we generate hostnames
		based on non-vulnerable RSA key-pairs.

		<br /><br />
		<b>We sell the generated vanity addresses for a flat rate of 0.1 Bitcoins.</b> Once
		you order the desired vanity address, we will generate the corresponding private key,
		and send it to you. Then the vanity address will be removed from our database. We can
		also prove that we own the given hostname by hosting a dummy website on the given
		vanity address.
		
		<br /><br />
		<b>DATABASE OF VANITY ADDRESSES IS AVAILABLE <a href="DB.html">HERE<a> (2.8 MB).</b>

		<br /><br />
		Note that our DB is consisted of about 100.000 entries, generated using 
		Intel Core i7-3720QM CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M GPU over the course of couple 
		of days of computing. If this website generates interest and sells at least 20
		vanity addresses, we will generate a fully-fledge automatic system to buy and
		manage vanity addresses. We aim at a system similar to the traditional DNS systems
		such as GoDaddy or NameCheap. Except that you will own your vanity addresses for life.
		
		<br /><br />
		If you are interested in having an address, send us an e-mail to: 
		<a href="mailto:vanityaddress@tuta.io" target="_top">vanityaddress@tuta.io</a>
		
		<br /><br />
		Some randomly chosen pre-generated vanity addresses.
